# multi-fit
multi-fit is a general tool that seeks to automatically detect peaks and fit to them on PSD data, derived from trapped levitating nanoparticles. The goal of this project is to allow fitting on a broad range of data input types and levitation schemes i.e. optical and electrical.

## Planned Features
1. Ability to change the form of the fitting function. JP
2. Compatibility with more types of input data (especially .csv). JP
8. Multithread buttons JK
11. Video Explanation of Software JK
12. Clear button for extra peaks JK
13. Save entry box inputs between sessions. JK
20. Retain guesses after auto-guess JK
21. Fix added peak annotations being too low JK
