# multi-fit
multi-fit is a general tool that seeks to automatically detect peaks and fit to them on PSD data, derived from trapped levitating nanoparticles. The goal of this project is to allow fitting on a broad range of data input types and levitation schemes i.e. optical and electrical.

8. Multithread buttons JK
11. Video Explanation of Software JK
12. Make a usable README JK
13. Clear button for extra peaks JK
21. Fix added peak annotations being too low JK
