# multi-fit
multi-fit is a general tool that seeks to automatically detect peaks and fit to them on PSD data, derived from trapped levitating nanoparticles. The goal of this project is to allow fitting on a broad range of data input types and levitation schemes i.e. optical and electrical.

## Planned Features
1. Ability to change the form of the fitting function. JP
2. Compatibility with more types of input data (especially .csv). JP
8. Multithread buttons JK
11. Make Amp guess more transparent (more info in README) JK
12. Clear button for extra peaks JK
13. Save entry box inputs between sessions. JK
15. Functional Binning JP
16. Exception handeling (JK/JS/JP)
19. Control over range of auto geusses (JS)
20. Retain guesses after auto-guess JK
